    "usage of props": "The primary characteristic of driving outside lane is its usage of props, which primarily includes utilizing the road's shoulder or adjacent lane for passing or turning, often involving no additional physical props beyond the standard driving equipment like turn signals and mirrors, enhancing safety and\""

  "jumping": {
    "Anomaly Type": "Jumping is primarily a Behavioral Anomaly, characterized by sudden, rapid movement upwards or across a distance, often exhibiting a deviation from normal patterns of motion or activity.'",
    "Sudden Change": "Jumping is characterized by a sudden change, typically involving the rapid appearance or disappearance of objects, or a sudden, marked behavior shift in the jumper's position or action.",
    "Normalcy Deviation": "Jumping is characterized by a Normalcy Deviation as it significantly strays from expected behavior in a scene, often attracting attention due to its sudden, unexpected vertical motion.'",
    "Impact": "Jumping impacts a scene by creating dynamic movement, affecting actors by requiring physical exertion and coordination, and can manipulate objects by applying force, often altering their position or state.",
    "Scene Type": "Jumping in a scene is typically characterized by dynamic, sudden movements, often involving a change in elevation, and is associated with action-oriented scenes that convey excitement, escape, or confrontation.",
    "Scene Elements": "Jumping in a scene is characterized by rapid vertical motion, involving elements like surprise, height, distance, and a quick take-off and landing, often contributing to excitement, escape, or action.'",
    "Scene Conditions": "Jumping in scene conditions typically involves a sudden, forceful upward movement, often requiring a burst of energy and muscle contraction, and is influenced by factors like gravity, surface friction, and the jumper's physical capabilities.",
    "usage of props": "Jumping primarily utilizes props for assistance, such as trampolines or poles, to enhance height, momentum, or to perform complex aerial maneuvers.",
    "Number of Actors": "Jumping typically involves one actor, where the primary characteristic is the solitary action of an individual leaping into the air, often from a stationary position, with the number of actors being singular.",
    "Clothing": "Jumping clothing is designed with flexibility, comfort, and freedom of movement in mind, typically featuring stretchable fabrics, secure fits, and durable construction to accommodate the dynamic motion of the activity.",
    "Actor Identity": "Jumping, in terms of Actor Identity, primarily characteristics an immediate shift in spatial positioning, often reflecting a burst of energy, quick decision-making, or an expression of emotion, typically associated with the actor's agility, vitality, or urgency.",
    "Facial Expression": "Jumping typically elicits a facial expression marked by widened eyes, raised eyebrows, and a mouth either stretched in a shocked grimace or opened in a joyful scream, reflecting a mix of surprise, thrill, and exertion.'",
    "Body move Speed": "Jumping is characterized by a rapid acceleration of body movement speed, involving a sudden upward force and a temporary suspension in mid-air, typically achieved through the explosive contraction of leg muscles.'",
    "Body Part Movement": "Jumping primarily involves a rapid extension of the legs, hips, and ankles, propelling the body upward, followed by a quick flexion of these body parts to land.'",
    "Body Posture": "Jumping is characterized by a rapid upward movement involving a simultaneous extension of the hips, knees, and ankles, with an arched back and often arms extended for balance, culminating in a moment of weightlessness.'",
    "Body Position": "Jumping typically involves a rapid upward force with the body positioned in a crouched stance, then extending the legs and arms, and lifting the hips and torso to leave the ground, often with feet off the ground simultaneously."
